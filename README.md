This is a mod to make Cookie Clicker more accessible with NVDA on Steam.
This mod only works with the Steam version of the game, and might only work with NVDA.

## Installation

1. Download [Cookie-Clicker-NVDA-Mod.zip](https://github.com/FioraXena/Cookie-Clicker-Enhanced-NVDA-Accessibility-Steam-Only-/raw/main/Cookie-Clicker-NVDA-Mod.zip)
2. Extract the zip file
3. Copy the "nvdaAccessibility" folder to your Cookie Clicker mods folder:
   `[Steam Install Path]\steamapps\common\Cookie Clicker\resources\app\mods\local\`
4. Launch Cookie Clicker and enable the mod in Options > Mods

## Features
Made the buildings section beneath a heading, along with buttons. It is now a little chunkier because now the text is displayed to us, rather than some attempt at hover workarounds.
Added "Time until affordable" to the buildings and upgrades sections.
You can now see how much your buildings are producing, per second (individual buildings, and with all owned of that specific building), and in percentage of your total CPS.
Added support for the upgrades store, with each actually showing labels on the buttons. You can now see the name, cost, effects, and flavor text of your upgrades, so you know what you are purchasing.
Added support to the Ascension mechanic, so you aren't blindly flailing to prestige. You can now browse the list of Heavenly upgrades, and actually spend your chips. Remember, you won't be looking at all of them from the start...
Updated the Grimoire to show the names of the spells, alongside the cost, and gave the effects of each beside them.
Tentatively got the mini-game area, and sugar-lump-spending area to show things correctly (might need sighted confirmation), to be labelled.
Added support to the Sugar Lump timer.
Added support to the Stock Market... maybe.
Added support for the Pantheon mini-game.
Made drag-and-drop mechanics accessible. (So you can place your permanent upgrades, get the most of your dragon, and get help from Santa.)
Added a little "Cookies per click" area right below the Big Cookie button, so you don't have to go hunting for it in the Statistics menu.
Added a milk progress display showing your current milk type, rank, and percentage.
Added live announcements for shimmers - you'll hear when a Golden Cookie, Wrath Cookie, or Reindeer appears, and when it's about to fade away. Click them manually in the game as you normally would.
Made an H2 heading after the buildings to see your active buffs, and wrinklers.

## Known Issues

- **Statistics menu**: Goals for enhanced statistics menu accessibility have been abandoned.
